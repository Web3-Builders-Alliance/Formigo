### Opportunity:

1.  Cisco found that 86% of consumers value data privacy, with 79% willing to invest in data protection, and nearly half switching companies over data policies. ~_Cisco_
2.  The online survey software market was worth $5.12 billion in 2022 and is expected to reach $11.03 billion by 2030, growing at a 10.06% CAGR from 2023. ~_verifiedmarketresearch.com_
3.  In 2018, Typeform experienced a data breach impacting approximately 20,000 users who had engaged in surveys on their platform, and there are allegations of a data breach involving QuestionPro last year. _~bleepingcomputer.com_

### The Problem: _Inadequate data control and transparency in traditional survey platforms._

1.  Many survey platforms retain data ownership, raising privacy and control issues for participants.
2.  May fail to secure user data, risking breaches and misuse of sensitive information.
3.  Lack transparency, making it hard to verify the authenticity and integrity of collected data.

### Our Solution: _An On-chain survey platform where users take ownership of their data and ensure data integrity through a Solana program._

1.  Full ownership and control of their survey data, maintaining sovereignty over their information.
2.  Enhanced data privacy and security, with robust encryption and decentralized storage to mitigate data breach risks.
3.  Survey and Survey responses are recorded on the ledger, ensuring unalterable, transparent, and verifiable records for data integrity and authenticity.
